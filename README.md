## Introduction
The C++ Quiz is a simple console-based application that demonstrates the basic features of the C++ language. The quiz consists of multiple-choice questions and provides instant feedback on the answers.

## Installation
To compile and run the program, you need a C++ compiler. If you don't have one installed, you can download one from the official GCC or MinGW websites. Once you have a compiler installed, you can compile the program using the following command:

```bash
g++ main.cpp -o main
```

This will create an executable file named quiz.

Usage
To run the program, use the following command:
```bash
./main
```

Follow the on-screen instructions to take the quiz.
